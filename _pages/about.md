Hi! I'm **Shafayet Nur**, currently working in bioinformatics and metagenomics.  
Iâ€™m passionate about understanding how microbial communities interact with their environments through computational tools and genomic data.

My work involves analyzing metagenomic bins, annotating genes, and studying nitrogen cycling pathways.

Outside the lab, I enjoy teaching, mentoring students, and contributing to open-source bioinformatics resources.
