Hi! I'm **Shafayet Nur**, a bioinformatics researcher and teaching assistant passionate about computational biology, metagenomics, and data-driven biological discovery.

My research focuses on analyzing microbial communities and nitrogen cycling pathways using metagenomic datasets. I enjoy working with large-scale genomic data, building computational pipelines, and uncovering biological insights from complex ecosystems.

Outside research, I take pride in mentoring students, assisting in lab-based teaching, and sharing scientific curiosity.
