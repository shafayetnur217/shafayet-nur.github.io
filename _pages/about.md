I am a Ph.D. student at Northern Illinois University, where my research focuses on large language models (LLMs) and their applications in public health. Before starting my Ph.D., I worked as a Lecturer in Computer Science and Engineering at Port City International University, Bangladesh. My research interests include multimodal NLP, machine learning, and AI for social good. I am passionate about exploring how language and vision models can work together to understand complex real-world data and make technology more accessible and impactful. Beyond research, I love mentoring students, collaborating on innovative ideas, and continuously learning how AI can better serve people and communities.
