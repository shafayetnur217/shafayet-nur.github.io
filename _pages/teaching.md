Iâ€™ve served as a **Teaching Assistant** for several undergraduate lab courses, where my responsibilities included:

- Conducting and supervising lab experiments  
- Preparing reagents and equipment setups  
- Grading assignments and lab reports  
- Tutoring and mentoring students in scientific methods  

I was nominated for the **Outstanding Teaching Assistant Award** for my commitment to supporting student learning.
