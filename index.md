Iâ€™m **Shafayet Nur**, a *Ph.D. student* and *Graduate Teaching Assistant* in the Department of Computer Science at **Northern Illinois University**, located in **DeKalb, Illinois, USA**.

My research focuses on applying **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to solve challenges in **public health**, especially through **multimodal learning**, where language and vision models work together to interpret complex real-world data.

Before beginning my Ph.D., I worked as a **Lecturer in Computer Science and Engineering** at *Port City International University, Bangladesh*.  
My broader research interests include **multimodal NLP**, **machine learning**, and **responsible AI**.
